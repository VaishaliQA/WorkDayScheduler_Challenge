# WorkDayScheduler_Challenge
### Description
I have created simple calender application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery. Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future.
